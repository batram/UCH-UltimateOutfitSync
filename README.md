# Ultimate Outfit
This is an `Ultimate Chicken Horse` `BepInEx` mod that allows you replace characters, outfits and textures without any asset patching. Just drop the png into the `textures` folder with the name of what you want to replace. There is an advanced option under `outfits` folder that allows more freedom (coordinates, sizes, pivot, pixelperunits). It's recommended to use the `outfits` options. `textures` is for legacy.
